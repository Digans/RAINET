[INTERACTOME]

INTERACTOME_DEFINITION = /big-vol/Rainet2toad/data/human/human.pairmap
This file contains the list of Protein-Protein interaction retrieved from several databases.
It is produced during the execution of the psicquic_wrapper.pl script  of the MoonGo tool (see tagc-moongo project on sourcesup)
and is named $SPECIES.pairmap (See 'building_data_freeze.sh' for details).
psicquic_wrapper.pl -FdBv --binary --net-file $SPECIES.gr --flat-file $SPECIES.flat -p $SPECIES.psi --psi2id $SPECIES.psi2id -s $SPECIES -y 0.95

INTERACTOME_NETWORK_DEFINITION
This file contains the PPI network definition (list of protein-protein interactions).
It is produced the execution of the psicquic_wrapper.pl script of the MoonGo tool (see tagc-moongo project on sourcesup) 
and is named $SPECIES.gr (See 'building_data_freeze.sh' for details).
Note that if the -y option is used, a Non-Redundant network is also produced with name $SPECIES.nr<nrscore>.gr where <nrscore> is the redundancy
score provided by the -y option.

INTERACTOME_NETWORK_PARTITION_DEFINITION = /big-vol/Rainet2toad/data/human/human.nr0.95.clas
This file contains definition of the classes of the partition of the PPI Network.
It is produced by a partitioning software like OCG  (see tagc-ocg project on sourcesup).
Note: this program must be run on connex graph. It is necessary to verify the graph produced by the previous
step is connex.
ocg human.nr0.95.gr > human.nr0.95.clas

INTERACTOME_NETWORK_PARTITION_ANNOTATION = /big-vol/Rainet2toad/data/human/human.nr0.95.fm
This file contains the GO annotation of the PPI Network partition.
It is produced by the annotation python code developped by Benoit (see tagc-ocg project on sourcesup)
